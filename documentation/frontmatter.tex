       This is our semester project in which we studied noise from source \emph{zener diode} specifically BZX55C5V1. We looked for low frequency flicker noise, johnson noise and shot noise traces. In this project we used a lock-in amplifier specifically SR830 which is relatively accurate and low noise. We used the relative capability of SR830 that of minimum detection around 10nV/Hz signal. We made open source community with making python library \emph{pyinstro} for controlling and interfacing instruments like SR830. This program is made to be very flexible and highly extensible for use in every SCPI supported interface like GPIB, RS232, USB, LAN with capabilities like built-in file writer (.csv) and some CLI argument parsing.} \vskip10pt \hrule \vskip10pt}
